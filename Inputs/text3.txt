Ron: “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess”

Harry: “We’re not offended, Just tell us what to do.”

Ron: “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.”

Hermione: “What about you?”

Ron: “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.

Harry: “Ron, you don’t suppose this is going to be like real wizard’s chess, do you?”

Ron: “You there, Hermione, move over. Don’t argue, hurry up.”

Hermione: “Ron, you’re not going to sacrifice yourself!”

Ron: “That’s chess! You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I’ll make my move and she’ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”

Harry: “But ”

Ron: “Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it’s you that has to go on, I know it.”
