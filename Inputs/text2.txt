Dumbledore: “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” 

Dumbledore: “So you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised,”

Harry: “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”

Dumbledore: “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”

Harry: “It well it shows me my family and it showed Ron as head boy.”

Dumbledore: “How does it work? Exactly?”

Harry: “It shows us what we want whatever we wan”

Dumbledore: “Yes and no It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.”
